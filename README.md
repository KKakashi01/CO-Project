# CO-Project
This project implements a simple instruction encoder in C++. It reads assembly-like instructions from a text file, translates them into a specific binary format, and writes the results into an output file. The encoder recognizes various instructions and formats, mapping them to corresponding hexadecimal and binary representations.
